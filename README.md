## Why Zyntrox?

- **Open Source** - you can view code, distribute it and contribute to it. And if you don't believe to good intentions, you can always check the code and compile it yourself.
- **Modable** - you can add your own plugins to Zyntrox by contributing to it or by pasting special external plugin JSON.
- **First Zyntra mod** - I am making better ZYntra community with Zyntrox before the Zyntra public beta was released.
